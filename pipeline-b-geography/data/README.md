# Pipeline B: Geography Data Files

## 🌍 Geographic Datasets

This folder contains **organized geographic spending datasets** collected using Pipeline B notebooks, separated into two distinct analysis approaches.

## 📂 Data Organization

### 🗺️ [`basic-geography/`](basic-geography/)
**Total spending by location** without agency filtering:
- `geography_country_all_FY2008_2024.csv` - International and domestic totals
- `geography_state_all_FY2008_2024.csv` - State-level spending distribution
- `geography_county_all_FY2008_2024.csv` - County-level spending patterns  
- `geography_district_all_FY2008_2024.csv` - Congressional district totals

**Use for**: Regional equity analysis, total geographic impact studies, baseline location analysis

### 🏛️ [`agency-geography/`](agency-geography/)
**Agency-filtered spending by location** with dual perspectives:
- `geo_*_funding_ALL_FY.csv` - Spending by funding agencies across locations
- `geo_*_awarding_ALL_FY.csv` - Spending by awarding agencies across locations
- `toptier_roster_cache.csv` - Federal agency directory cache

**Use for**: Agency geographic footprint analysis, funding vs awarding comparisons, multi-dimensional studies

## 🔄 Data Collection Process

To populate this folder, run the Pipeline B notebooks:

1. **`Geography_basic.ipynb`** - Collects basic geographic spending data
2. **`agency_geography.ipynb`** - Collects agency-filtered geographic data

## 📊 Dataset Schemas

### Basic Geography Schema
- `code`: Geographic identifier (ISO/FIPS/District code)
- `name`: Geographic display name
- `amount`: Obligation amount (numeric)
- `population`: When provided by API
- `fy`, `quarter`: Temporal dimensions
- `geo_layer`: Geographic granularity level

### Agency-Enhanced Geography Schema
- **All basic columns** plus:
- `agency_type`: "funding" or "awarding"
- `agency_code`: 3-digit toptier agency code
- `agency_name`: Official agency name

## 📈 Analysis Applications

- **Geographic Distribution**: Where federal funds are being spent
- **Regional Equity**: Fair distribution analysis across regions
- **Agency Geographic Footprint**: Which agencies spend where
- **Congressional Analysis**: District-level spending patterns
- **Economic Impact**: Regional effects of federal spending

## 🎯 Coverage

- **Geographic Levels**: Country, State, County, Congressional District
- **Temporal Coverage**: FY2008-2024, Quarterly granularity
- **Agency Perspectives**: Both funding and awarding agency views
